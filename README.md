=====================================

=== Whet is this repo for ===
This is a student project (ECE Paris), for the year 2013-2014. I am aprt of a 6 students group
I choose to use the C programming langage, because I am too lazy to learn a new programming langage

=== What has been used ===
- a post from redcode, very usefull, altough it used java http://www.redcode.nl/blog/2010/06/creating-shazam-in-java/
- Fmod ex : not really working
- SDL for all graphic rendering http://www.libsdl.org/
- fftw for Fourier transforms http://www.fftw.org/

=== History ===
- sept - oct : googling ... found this a post on redcode about a shazam coded with java
- nov : start coding : tryed the Fourier Transform with Fmod ex and a graphic render for spectrogram with SDL
  Not really working, moreover spectrogram are funny bur useless 
- dec : found the fftw lib, the paramount for Fourier transform. It own a large amount of FFT functions,
  I tryed one randomly, looks good for a beginning - need some adjustements but nice results
